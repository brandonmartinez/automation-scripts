# GitHub Copilot Configuration

## Project Context
This project contains shell scripts written exclusively for **zsh**. All scripts should:
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env zsh` shebang
- Follow zsh syntax and conventions
- Be compatible with zsh-specific features

## Code Generation Guidelines
When suggesting code for this project:
- Always assume zsh shell environment
- Use zsh array syntax: `"${array[@]}"` for expansion, `"${!array[@]}"` for indices
- Prefer zsh built-ins and idioms
- Use zsh-compatible parameter expansion
- Follow the existing logging patterns from `utilities/logging.sh`

## Script Standards
- Set shell options: `set -o errexit -o nounset -o pipefail`
- Use proper error handling with exit codes
- Include comprehensive logging with emoji indicators
- Follow the established directory structure and naming conventions
