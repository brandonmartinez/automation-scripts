# GitHub Copilot Configuration

## Project Context

This project contains shell scripts written exclusively for **zsh**. All scripts should:

- Use `#!/usr/bin/env zsh` shebang
- Follow zsh syntax and conventions
- Be compatible with zsh-specific features

## Code Generation Guidelines

When suggesting code for this project:

- Always assume zsh shell environment
- Use zsh array syntax: `"${array[@]}"` for expansion, `"${!array[@]}"` for indices
- Prefer zsh built-ins and idioms
- Use zsh-compatible parameter expansion
- Follow the existing logging patterns from `utilities/logging.sh`
- When invoking common nix utilities (e.g., cat, ls, grep, sed), prefix them with `command` to bypass user-defined aliases in the shell profile
- Favor pure zsh scripts—do not introduce Python, Node, Ruby, or other languages unless the user explicitly approves and there is a compelling benefit; ask before suggesting any non-shell helper code

## Script Standards

- Set shell options: `set -o errexit -o nounset -o pipefail`
- Use proper error handling with exit codes
- Include comprehensive logging with emoji indicators
- Follow the established directory structure and naming conventions
